# Welcome to your first lab in the Coding Nomads Go course!

Please follow the following steps to complete this lab:

- Make sure you have this lab open in your text editor or IDE  
  The `lab_01.go` file has a bunch of weird spacing, luckily go has a built in tool to keep our code nice and tidy. We'll be using it in the next steps.
- Navigate in your terminal to `labs/lab_01/`
- Run `gofmt -w lab_01.go` and reload in your text editor.  
  This can be kind of time consuming to do every time, but luckily there are extensions that can run `gofmt` on save. If you followed along the VS Code setup instructions you will have installed a package that will do just that. Test this to see if it also works.
- Now run `go run lab_01.go` in your terminal.

Congratulations, you just ran a Go program!

Now navigate back to the course to continue your journey to Gopher-dom.
